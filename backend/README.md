## API Integration with Angular Frontend

The backend is designed to work seamlessly with the Angular frontend. Update your Angular AI tutor service to use these endpoints:

```typescript
// In your Angular ai-tutor.service.ts
private baseUrl = 'http://localhost:8000';

async sendMessage(message: string, history: ChatMessage[]): Promise<TutorResponse> {
  const response = await this.http.post<TutorResponse>(`${this.baseUrl}/api/tutor/chat`, {
    message,
    conversation_history: history,
    user_level: 'intermediate'
  }).toPromise();
  
  return response;
}
```
